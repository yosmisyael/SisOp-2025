# Functions of the Operating System Summary



## 1. Process Management:

- Core: Manages the execution of programs (processes). Handles creation, deletion, suspension, resumption, synchronization, communication, and deadlock prevention of processes and threads.
- Purpose: Enables concurrent execution of multiple programs by multiplexing CPU resources.

## 2. Memory Management:

- Core: Controls the allocation and deallocation of memory to processes. Determines what data and program parts are in memory and when.
- Purpose: Optimizes CPU utilization and system responsiveness by efficiently managing memory resources.

## 3. File-System Management:

- Core: Provides a logical view of data storage through files and directories. Manages file access, organization, and storage mapping.
- Purpose: Abstracts physical storage details, enabling users to interact with files in a uniform and logical manner.

## 4. Mass-Storage Management:

- Core: Manages secondary storage (disks, tapes, etc.) for long-term data storage. Includes mounting, free-space management, disk scheduling, and protection.

- Purpose: Ensures efficient and reliable storage and retrieval of data that doesn't fit in main memory.


## 5. Caching:

- Core: Temporarily stores frequently used data in faster storage (cache) to improve access speed.

- Purpose: Enhances performance by reducing the need to access slower storage devices.

## 6. I/O Subsystem:

- Core: Manages communication between the OS and hardware devices. Handles buffering, caching, spooling, and device drivers.

- Purpose: Hides hardware complexities from users and provides a consistent interface for I/O operations.

## 7. Protection and Security:

- Core: Controls access to system resources by processes and users. Protects the system from internal and external threats.

- Purpose: Ensures data integrity, system stability, and prevents unauthorized access or malicious activities.

## 8. Virtualization:

- Core: Enables running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. Includes emulation, interpretation, and native virtualization.

- Purpose: Allows for resource consolidation, application compatibility, and testing in isolated environments.
